# openGMC
open software for the GMC-300E, and probably other GMC model, Geiger counters.

Current features:
-Graph of CPS
-CPM display
-Snapshot at new peak
-Peak CPS display
-Logging to file

Known limitations:
-Incompatable with some counters from the GMC range (cant afford to test all of em :c)
-Graph cannot display numbers over 9 on the lower numeric display without overlapping
-CPM display internally calculated, sometimes inaccurate
